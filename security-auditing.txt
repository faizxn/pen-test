#Security Assets:> photos .. bank accounts details .. account information - (linkedin.. facebook.. amazon).. browser history.. password information.. financial records


 Auditing:

	# soc: (soc needs siem software that helps an organization to protect its infrastucture and information as internal and external threats)
				+ log collectors.. correlation enginer and log visualizers
				+ threat intelligence and signature updates
				+ integration of endpoint.. servers .. network devices and applications ensure all event logs are collected in siem.
				+ storage to manage log data
				+ incident reponders are trainied to handle incidents
				+ make sure SIEM solution has an alternative facility or DR 
				+ compliance requirements like pci-dss

		
	
	# incident management: (involves returning services to normal as soon as possible after incident has occured)
		
				+ check and verify incident management policy approved and review regularly. make sure incident plans rules and reposibilites escalation metrics etc
				+ make sure there is way to report incident by employee

				+ make sure incident are prioritize based on impact and adequte resource are aligned to resolve it
				+ make sure critical incident are reported to management
				+ check and verify time to reponse and time to resolve that SLA meet
				+ check and verify all the evidence are stored in secure place
	
	
				
	# change management: (in the absence of a proper change management process unauthorized change activites will lead to intentional or unintentional damage to 
enterprise infrastucture.. application and data)
				
				+ a change management policy like user roles and reposibilites.. regular.. standard and emergency change 
				+ major change requests approvals from business unit head.. techical head
				+ business requirements.. impact analysis.. system requirements are app
				+ make sure test cases.. test results are verified and change is released in the production
				+ check and verify release plans.. polices.. procedues.. authorization for emergency changes
				+ check and verify all the changes are performed are validated and verfied
	
	
	
	# hr security:
	
				+ background verification.. police verification.. and work experience.. address and drug checks etc
	
	
	
	# network security: 
	
				+ check and verify network security policy and architecture diagram is update and regularly reviewed
				+ enterprise network seregrated into zones like dmz.. internal.. production and guest.. check and verify internal..dmz and external network not directly connected
				+ no single point of failure (spof) for firewall.. router and switch.. check and verify that guest network is fully isolated
				+ make sure data is secure over network by encryption or secure protocol like https.. ssh.. vpn tunnel
				+ all netwoking devices are maintained in as asset register with details such as ownership..asset and details
				+ any changes to network devices, logs are maintained and review regularly
				+ network devices hardened.. default/generic user ids and passwords are changed or disabled
				+ make sure lastest security patches are installed
				+ make sure that all security related events from devices are logged to a syslog server
				
				
	
	# backup and restoration: backups are the heart of business continuity management. its an important activity for an organization
	
				+ backup of transaction data.. user data and configuration data.. logs.. cctv footage.. physical access etc
				+ backup polices are defined on the servers.. network devices and databases etc configured.. implemented and reviewed regularly
				+ backup servers are secured and protected physically.. logically protected in the data center
				+ backup taken as per defined periodic and monitored for failed backup jobs
				+ make sure confidential and sensitive data is encrypted in the database
				+ backup the devices label and tapes check for expiry 
				+ verify the integrity of the backup by performing regular restoration test
	
				
				
	# antivirus management:
				
				+ configured to scan all the internet downloads .. usb devices and files.. user restriction to modify the configuration
				+ malware events as well as administrator activites are logged .. monitored and acted upon 
				+ manage daily.. weekly.. monthly compliance.. isses tracked and resolved and reports
				
				
				
	# it compliance:
	
				+ verify the evidences of all relevant statutory that is achieved by organization on a regular basis
				+ data protection and privacy policy is communicated to all persons involved  in information within organization
				+ software is acquired from known source. no copy right violation and no unauthorized software can be installed
				+ sensitive data in transit have adequate encryption as per regulation.. use of cryptography is an compliance
				+ audits are performed and findings are recorded.. followed up and evidences are securely preserved for future reference				
				
				
				
	# it asset management:
	
				+ make sure an organization maintained and stored asset information in software
				+ make sure all the assets are classifed and labelled in the inventory
				+ make sure there is a process of asset verification and tracking is performed regularly
		
				
	# data center: where cloud is hosted
				
				+ make sure that data center access is provided to legitimated users upon approvals
				+ make sure visitors access is logged and visitors is always escorted by an employee
				+ make sure that security alarms are working effectively
				+ make sure data center has power and cooling redundancy.. moisture .. fire and sensores are installed
				
				
				
	# endpoint security:
				
				+ make sure endpoint part is corporate domain
				+ make sure opeating system copy is valid.. verified and legitimated 
				+ make sure antivirus and required patches are installed and upto date.
				+ make sure user does not have right to change the registry or change the system setting.. install/uninstall.. start or stop services.. changes the date and time
				+ make sure USB port is disabled
				+ bios access retricted with admin passwords
				+ make sure user can not create or run batch files
				+ make sure user has resticted internet access and access to network is based on business requirements
