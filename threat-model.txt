			- business impact analysis
	
	
	# Define Technical Scope:

			- capture the boundaries of the technical enviroment
			- capture the infrastructure.. application and software dependencises
	
	
	# Application Decomposition:	

			- identify use case
			- identify actors .. assets.. services .. roles.. data resources
			- data flow datagram

			
	# Threat Analysis:	

			- probabilistic attack scenarios analysis
