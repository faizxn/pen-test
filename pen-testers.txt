						 different types of penetration tests include network services + web and mobile applications + different of servers + social engineering + etc +  
					   
 # goal of penetration-testing:
			+ regulatory compliance
			+ security assesment
			+ defense development
	
		
 # how it works: testing phase:
			+ planning phase
			+ discovery phase
			+ attack phase
			+ reporting phase


 # types of penetration-testers:
 
			+ black box	> tester has no idea about the systems that he is going to test. he is interested to gather information.	
			+ white box > tester has been provided with whole range of information about the systems.
			+ grey box 	> tester usually provides partial or limited information about the internal details of the program of a system.
